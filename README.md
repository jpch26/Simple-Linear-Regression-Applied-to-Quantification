R in the Lab: Simple Linear Regression Applied to Quantification
================

A R tutorial about how to perform a simple linear regression applied to
a quantification problem.

Note that I did not explain how I simulated the experimental data, but
you can see the code on data\_simulation.R

If you have cloned this repository and want to run this analysis from
scratch first run erase\_all\_outputs.R script and then run Main.R
script o whichever script you want.

You can the presentation for this tutorial by cliking on: [Simple Linear Regression Applied to Quantification](https://r-in-the-lab.netlify.app/2021/02/01/simple-linear-regression-applied-to-quantification/).
